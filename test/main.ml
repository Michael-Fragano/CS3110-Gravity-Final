(**We primarily tested the functions of Gravity.ml to make sure they
   returned expected result, as ultimately all other parts of the
   program relied on this file to run. We used glass box testing, trying
   to test each path a function could take. Other functions in places
   such as visuals.ml and create.ml are not tested here as their outputs
   are primarily graphical, so they can only really be tested by looking
   at a running program rendering the graphics. For testing this, we
   have several pre-written json files that help us determine if
   anything is rendered improperly. *)
